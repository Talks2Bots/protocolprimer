title: "About Protocol Primer"
---

Protocol Primer is a resource dedicated to explaining technical changes in Bitcoin in simple, neutral language. Our mission is to bridge the gap between technical developers and the broader Bitcoin community.

## Our Approach

We believe that understanding Bitcoin's protocol changes shouldn't require advanced technical knowledge. Our content aims to:

1. **Simplify complex concepts** without losing technical accuracy
2. **Remain neutral** in our explanations, presenting facts without bias
3. **Provide context** for why changes are being proposed or implemented
4. **Make Bitcoin development more accessible** to a wider audience
