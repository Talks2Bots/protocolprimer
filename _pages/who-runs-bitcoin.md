Bitcoin is often described as decentralized. That's true—but it doesn't mean nobody runs it. It means **everybody who participates** plays a role in keeping it alive.

<!-- Example of how to include an image:

-->

And because Bitcoin means different things to different people—freedom, savings, infrastructure, rebellion, or simply curiosity—it can lead to passionate debates. Some of those are playing out right now. You may have heard there's a new disagreement. We won't get into the details here. This article is about something deeper.

It's about **who manages Bitcoin**, and more importantly, **why it matters that you're part of that process**.

## There's No CEO of Bitcoin

There's no central company, no board of directors, and no one to call when something goes wrong. Bitcoin is a living network that runs because people choose to keep it running. That includes:

- **Developers**, who write and test the code (like Bitcoin Core and Knots)  
- **Miners**, who secure the network and add new blocks to the chain  
- And **node operators**—people like you—who independently verify everything

Of these, node operators are the quiet backbone. You're not mining coins. You're not coding the protocol. You're doing something just as important: **you're saying "I agree with these rules," and "I won't accept anything else."**

That's what gives Bitcoin its strength.

## Disagreements Are Part of the Deal

Because Bitcoin is decentralized, people disagree. Often strongly. Sometimes those disagreements are about policy. Sometimes they're about privacy, or fees, or how Bitcoin should evolve. None of that is a bug. It's **how decentralized systems work**.

There's no final authority to make decisions. Instead, the network moves forward when enough participants—especially **nodes**—agree to follow a given path.

That means **your choices matter**. Even if you're not a developer or miner, the software you run, the version you choose, and the settings you enable shape Bitcoin's future.

## Why This Website Exists

If you're running a node—on a Raspberry Pi, on a server, or even on your laptop—you're participating in Bitcoin governance. But staying informed can be hard. It's technical. The forums are noisy. And not everyone has time to follow every debate.

That's what this site is for.

We don't take sides. We won't tell you what to run. We just want to help you **understand what's happening**, what your options are, and what others are doing—so you can make your own informed decisions.

Because in the end, **Bitcoin's soul isn't protected by influencers, or coders, or institutions**.

It's shepherded by people who care enough to run a node, and keep it running.
