Welcome to Protocol Primer, a new resource dedicated to explaining technical changes in Bitcoin in simple, neutral language.

## Why Protocol Primer?

Understanding Bitcoin protocol changes can be challenging, especially for non-developers. Many explanations are either too technical or written with specific biases. Protocol Primer aims to bridge this gap by:

1. Breaking down complex protocol changes into simpler explanations
2. Providing neutral, factual information without bias
3. Making Bitcoin technical developments accessible to a wider audience

## What to Expect

In the coming weeks, we'll be covering various topics including:

- Explanation of Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs)
- Analysis of recent protocol upgrades
- Breakdowns of proposed changes to the Bitcoin network
- Simplified explanations of technical concepts

Stay tuned for our first technical breakdown coming soon!
